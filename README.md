# ASE-analysis (allelic specific expression analysis)
Advanced Scientific Python Programming (ASPP 2024) course project

the Project for the Advanced Scientific Python Programming 2024.

In this project, I will try to create a pipline for the allelic specific expression analysis. It link the SNP (Single-nucleotide polymorphism) site and the RNA-seq data.
I will try to see the correlation between the SNP site and the gene expression to see the different gene expression in the two genome.
